The Contiki Operating System
============================

This is a port of contiki2.7 that works with the zigduino and arduIMU and other arduino-like boards (that is, it uses AVRDUDE for programming)

use ala:

make TARGET=avr-atmega128rfa1 project\_name.u AVRDUDE\_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0

make login





Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power
microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that
make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized
low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems,
such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical
power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring,
construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring,
and so on.
